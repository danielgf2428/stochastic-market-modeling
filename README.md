# Stochastic Market Modeling & Simulation

## Abstract
This paper presents an applied approach to market scenario simulation using the R programming language. Based on the theoretical foundation of stochastic modeling of asset prices, our emphasis is placed on the practical implementation of simulations and the insights they provide. We show how freely available financial data (in our case, from BBVA) can be downloaded and processed in R, and how simple statistical tools allow us to estimate the necessary parameters. We will generate a wide range of possible future market trajectories, and the results will be visualized through R’s graphical libraries, which make the uncertainty of financial markets more tangible. The study highlights the value of computational experimentation: even with basic models, simulation in R provides a clear and flexible way to explore potential outcomes and risks in financial markets.
